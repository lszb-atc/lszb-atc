# ATC audio streams of Bern-Belp Airport (LSZB)

The radio transmissions between the air traffic controllers and the pilots are extremely exciting. And thanks to modern technologies, you can even listen to these radio messages live and free of charge worldwide via the Internet. The great website [liveatc.net](http://liveatc.net) makes this possible for many airports worldwide! Also for Bern-Belp Airport (LSZB, BRN) in Switzerland, which is the focus of this website.

## A short explanation of the individual channels:
- **LSZB App/Dep:** Arrival&Departure controls the (instrument) arrivals and the (instrument) departures. 
- **LSZB ATIS:** Stands for *[Automatic Terminal Information Service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_terminal_information_service)*. Automatic broadcasts with current information on weather and flight operations. Listened to by pilots prior to initial radio contact.
- **LSZB Clearance Delivery:** Provides engine start clearance and flight path clearance for instrument flights. This channel is only in operation during heavy traffic, otherwise these clearances are also given by the tower. Whether Clearence Delivery is active is indicated on the ATIS. 
- **LSZB Del/Twr/App:** A *stereo-mixture* of the three channels Tower (left), Clearence Delivery (center), Arrival&Departure (right).
- **LSZB Tower:** Controls taxiing (rolling) traffic on the ground as well as local air traffic in the vicinity of the airport.
- **LSZB Twr/App:** A *scanner* of the two channels Tower and Arrival&Departure. Only one channel with activity is audible at a time. After holding at an active channel, both channels are monitored again.

## Recommendation for your start

1. At the beginning I would listen to the **ATIS**. There is always something to hear - even if it is only the announcement that the airport is currently closed... ;-)

2. Then I would maybe listen to the **Tower**, where the aircraft are controlled on the ground and in the vicinity of the airport.

3. If there is little activity, I recommend the **scanner channel**, where you can hear either the tower or Arrival&Departure, depending on which channel is currently active.

4. For the very experienced listener, I recommend the mixed channel where you hear Tower (left), Clearence Delivery (center) and Arrival&Departure (right) simultaneously in stereo panorama. But be careful: If two or three channels are active at the same time, understanding the simultaneous radio messages becomes a real challenge. Are you ready for it...? ;-)

## Radar Map
There are also several websites on the Internet where you can track the aircraft that can be detected by ADS-B parallel to the aircraft radio. Very exciting, if you can see the aircraft on the map at the same time as listening to the ATC.
